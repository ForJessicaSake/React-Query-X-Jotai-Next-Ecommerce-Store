## Next Ecommerce Store
The Furniture Ecommerce store is still in progress....

## About project
I wanted to do build something that'll enable me work with a ton of states cause I had just learnt how to use Jotai and React Query. In the process of exploring, I built this basic ecommerce store using React, TypeScript, Jotai, React Query, and Tailwind. It's a showcase of how these technologies can come together to create an awesome user experience. TypeScript keeps my code neat and tidy, Tailwind gives the project a cool look while, Jotai and React Query make state management a breeze.
